^ We use it every day for a number of different purposes

---

# üì≤

^ Navigation in simple terms, process of going from one screen to the next

---

```kotlin
val history = ArrayDeque<Screen>()

history.addLast(ForwardScreen)

history.removeLast()
```

^ If navigation were so simple, surely we could just use a deque

^ We could... in theory

---

# ü§¶

^ Complications come in many forms, mostly human

---

# ‚Üî

^ More than just forward/backward navigation

^ More than just a history

---

[.footer: m3.material.io/components/navigation-bar/overview]

![left](side-navigation-rail.png)

![right](bottom-navigation-bar.png)

^ Navigation concepts like the rail or bottom bar introduce parallel navigation

^ Horizontal in addition to vertical

---

[.footer: satukyrolainen.com/affordances]

![](faucet-with-false-affrodance.jpg)

^ Affordance is how a user expects to interact with something

---

# ü§ñ üçè üñ•Ô∏è

^ Behaviour should be consistent with platform expectation

---

[.footer: android-developers.googleblog.com/2022/05/form-factors-google-io-22.html]

![](android-form-factors.png)

^ Different form factors on the same platform will change how the user expects to navigate

---

[.footer-style: #666]

[.footer: learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/basics/navigation-history-and-backwards-navigation]

![](windows-back-enabled.png)

^ Even something as simple as back navigation differs significantly

^ Desktop apps might not even show a back button relying upon shortcuts

^ What is the expected behaviour?

---

# ‚Üë ‚Üê

^ Android has both up and back which are not the same

---

#  ‚Éï üî•

^ Maintaining a stack through configuration change

---

![50%](deep-links-sample.webp)

^ Handling deep links requires specific navigation behaviour

---

![](developing-hard.png)

^ Navigation is hard. Often a topic of confusion, difficult for new developers

^ Navigating from screen to screen being fundamental to your app

---

![align(top)](droidcon-berlin-navigation-and-the-single-activity.jpeg)

^ We've actually been there, 2019 Berlin talk on navigation

---

> ### "Once we have gotten in to this entry-point to your UI, we really don't care how you organise the flow inside."
-- Dianne Hackborn, Android Framework team, 2016

^ Controversial, framework not opinionated, does not care about app structure

---

# Jetpack Navigation

^ Google introduced Jetpack navigation

^ Tools for easy implementation of type safe navigation

^ Android only, XML based navigation graph

---

# 2019

^ That was over five years ago, a lot of changed since then

^ Billy Joel song worth of things have happened since then

---

# Fragments

^ Before then Fragments had been considered the worst thing ever

^ Plagued by lifecycle issues and weird back stack management

^ Despite alternative usage activities remained the most popular choice

---

[.footer: developer.squareup.com/blog/simpler-android-apps-with-flow-and-mortar]

## mortar & flow
### 2014

^ The idea of a more molecular UI structure had been entertained before

^ The folks at Square at created Mortar and Flow back in 2014

^ Mortar implemented screens with view layouts handling presenter detachment

^ Flow handled the navigation with a backstack model

---

[.footer: uber.com/en-GB/blog/new-rider-app-architecture]

## uber/ribs
### 2016

^ Continues in that vein of using view groups and presenters (VIPER)

^ Still under active development, mostly Kotlin (Java tests & tutorials)

^ Shared code between Android & iOS

---

## square: reactive workflows
### 2017

^ Square continued development of flow to it's

---

![right 15%](jetpack-navigation.png)

# Jetpack Navigation
### 2019

^ Android introduces Jetpack navigation

^ Fragments with a single activity

^ Skeptical, but gained popularity

---

## square/workflow
### 2019

---

# Compose UI
### 2021

![right 40%](wild-ui-framework.jpg)

^ Though Compose UI was announced at Google IO 2019

^ Didn't reach stable release until 2021

---

Introduces static ‚Äúlock and key‚Äù parameter mechanism with XML and ‚Äúsafe-args‚Äù code generation.

---

Development continued with custom navigation destination support, allowing for more options, possible to go back to activity based navigation in navigation graph, some animation support couldn‚Äôt be backported however due to Framework Activity vs Support Fragment.

---

The great abstraction of framework components continues‚Ä¶

---

Jetpack Navigation includes support for Compose destinations.

---

Jetpack Navigation includes support for type safe parameters in Kotlin üéâ

---

Moving priorities towards Kotlin Multiplatform, rise and trends, increased demand.

---

Compose Multiplatform

---

Introduction of third party libraries with Compose or Multiplatform first ideology, inherit idiomatic style.

---

## Role of Architecture

^ Something I asked myself when working with Compose and Molecule:

^ Given the movement of domain behaviour and state modelling to a Compose world;

^ What remains of the role of architecture components familiar to Android?

---

[.footer: github.com/slackhq/circuit]

## slackhq/circuit
### 2022

^ Circuit is a new Compose driven architecture for Android apps written by Zac and the folks at Slack

^ It‚Äôs a mechanism for handling navigation with @Parcelizable screens

---

- support for most KMP platforms now
- circuit-retained has become really powerful and sort of it's secret sauce. Works as a wormhole for managing state across the back stack and can even layer in with saveable
- https://chrisbanes.me/posts/retaining-beyond-viewmodels/
- CB has contributed a lot of clever features
- Lots of padded out functionality and features like multiple back stacks, navigation with results, expanded code gen support, circuitx artifacts

---

[.footer: arkivanov.github.io/Decompose]

## arkivanov/Decompose
### 2021

^ Similar to Circuit, included navigation stack behaviour, but encompassing support for multiplatform

^ Decompose is a Kotlin multiplatform library for sectioning your application into components

^ Providing abstraction of platform lifecycle configuration changes and navigation

### 2021

---

Multiplatform issues with Android state management, parcelization/bundling of state parameters needs to be handled. Modern approaches should use Kotlin serialization.

---

Google recently made multiplatform a priority with moving a lot of dependencies to common, navigation included.

---

As of the time of writing, Jetpack Navigation is not yet multiplatform however it is offered as a JetBrains Compose Multiplatform artifact

---

Compose Multiplatform is usually quite delayed, JetBrains works hard on maintaining compatibility, but does not yet offer serialized destinations

---

Multiplatform documentation is difficult as it's out-of-date

---

For better or for worse, ViewModel is now multiplatform.

---

Early adopters employed third party solutions, late adopters can migrate android navigation to multiplatform. The early bird got the worm, but the second mouse got the cheese.
