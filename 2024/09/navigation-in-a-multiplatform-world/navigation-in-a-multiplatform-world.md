^ We use it every day for a number of different purposes

---

# üì≤

^ Navigation in simple terms, process of going from one screen to the next

---

```kotlin
val history = ArrayDeque<Screen>()

history.addLast(ForwardScreen)

history.removeLast()
```

^ If navigation were so simple, surely we could just use a deque

^ We could... in theory

---

# ü§¶

^ Complications come in many forms, mostly human

---

# ‚Üî

^ More than just forward/backward navigation

^ More than just a history

---

^ Navigation concepts like the rail or bottom bar introduce parallel navigation

^ Horizontal in addition to vertical

> ### "Once we have gotten in to this entry-point to your UI, we really don't care how you organise the flow inside."
-- Dianne Hackborn, Android Framework team, 2016

^ Controversial, framework not opinionated, does not care about app structure

---

![right 15%](jetpack-navigation.png)

# Jetpack Navigation

^ Google introduced Jetpack navigation

^ Tools for easy implementation of type safe navigation

^ Android only, XML based navigation graph

---

![right](navigation-graph-fragments.png)

# Fragments

^ Before then Fragments had been considered the worst thing ever

^ Plagued by lifecycle issues and weird back stack management

^ Despite alternative usage activities remained the most popular choice

# Square
## mortar & flow
### 2014

^ The idea of a more molecular UI structure had been entertained before

^ The folks at Square at created Mortar and Flow back in 2014

^ Mortar implemented screens with view layouts handling presenter detachment

^ Flow handled the navigation with a backstack model

---

[.footer: uber.com/en-GB/blog/new-rider-app-architecture]

## uber/ribs
### 2016

^ Continues in that vein of using view groups and presenters (VIPER)

^ Still under active development, mostly Kotlin (Java tests & tutorials)

^ Shared code between Android & iOS

---

![](droidcon-nyc-workflow-pattern.png)

^ Square continued development of flow to it's development of workflows

^ Entertained reactive ideas, like immutability, separation of UI and state

---

[.footer: square.github.io/workflow]

## square/workflow
### 2019

^ Went on to develop Workflow, open source, released to production

^ Employs unidirection data flow, encouraging declarative syntax

^ Quite comprehensive as an architectural paradigm

^ Doesn't handle navigation in the traditional sense

^ Hierarchy of parent/child workflows react to state changes

^ Still under active development, docs currently stale

^ Elaborate

## ![inline 5%](jetpack-navigation.png) Moving On...

^ Besides a few outlyers, Jetpack Navigation was enough for most projects

^ Given the recommendation from Google, gave confidence

---

# Compose UI
### 2021

![right 40%](wild-ui-framework.jpg)

^ Though Compose UI was announced at Google IO 2019

^ Didn't reach stable release until 2021

---

# Compose UI

- Declarative UI Framework
- Open Source Kotlin

---

## Obligatory Notice ‚ö†Ô∏è
### Compose != Compose UI

^ Important to know the difference between Compose and Compose UI

---

[.footer: jakewharton.com/a-jetpack-compose-by-any-other-name]

> Compose is, at its core, a general-purpose tool for managing a tree of nodes of any type ... a ‚Äútree of nodes‚Äù describes just about anything, and as a result Compose can target just about anything.
-- Jake Wharton

^ Compose runtime and compiler for tree and property manipulation

^ Part of androidx repo managed by Google

^ Compose UI toolkit built upon that, projects need not include

---

## Jetpack Navigation Compose
### v2.4.0 (2021)

- Build a navigation graph with a `@Composable` Kotlin DSL
- Compose `viewModel()` scoped to navigation destination
- Desintation level scope for `rememberSaveable()`
- Automatic back handling support

^ Development continued with Jetpack Navigation in 2021 v1

^ Adding preliminary Compose support

---

### Jetpack Navigation Compose < v2.8.0

```kotlin
private const val HOME_ROUTE = "home"

NavHost(
    navController = navController,
    startDestination = ,
) {
    composable(route = HOME_ROUTE) {
        HomeScreen(
            onBackClick = navController::popBackStack,
            /* ... */
        )
    }
}
```

^ NavHost Composable DSL with creation of screens

^ Simple hierarchy, no separation of concerns

^ Fine for simple apps, does not scale

---

### Jetpack Navigation Compose < v2.8.0

```kotlin
private const val DETAIL_ID_KEY = "detailId"
private const val DETAIL_ROUTE = "detail"

NavHost(
    navController = navController,
    startDestination = DETAIL_ROUTE",
) {
    composable(
        route = DETAIL_ROUTE",
        arguments = listOf(
            navArgument(DETAIL_ID_KEY) {
                type = NavType.StringType
                defaultValue = null
                nullable = true
            }
        )
    ) {
        DetailScreen(/* ... */)
    }
}
```

^ Arguments would need to be registered into the declaration

^ With type information explicitly typed

---

### Jetpack Navigation Compose < v2.8.0

```kotlin
private const val DETAIL_ID_KEY = "detailId"

fun NavController.navigateToDetail(detailId: String) {
  navigate("detail?$DETAIL_ID_KEY=$detailId")
}

savedStateHandle.getStateFlow(DETAIL_ID_KEY, null)
```

^ Parameters would need to be encoded as strings

^ Retrieved from navController back stack or saved state handle

^ Implemented tightly with platform `SavedInstanceState`

---

### Jetpack Navigation Compose v2.8.0 (04.09.2024)

```kotlin
@Serializable
data class DetailRoute(val id: String)

NavHost(
    navController = navController,
    startDestination = "detail",
) {
    composable<DetailRoute> {
        DetailScreen(/* ... */)
    }
}

val route = savedStateHandle.toRoute<DetailRoute>()
```

^ That was until earlier this month when type safety was added

^ Using KotlinX serialization, the type is encoded into the route

^ Each framework specifying its own language and development / build environment

^ Whilst each of these languages have their own ecosystem of libraries etc

^ Not languages typically familiar to Android or mobile developers

^ Unless life has been particularly cruel to you

---

^ KMP starts small, doesn‚Äôt require sharing everything

^ Build components in a way that makes sense for you

    implementation("androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-viewmodel-ktx:2.8.5")
  }
}

// Backed by ViewModelImpl
public expect abstract class ViewModel
```

# ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

^ For better or for worse, ViewModel is now multiplatform.

---

# Multiplatform Architecture

^ Whilst there are some components from androidx becoming available

^ We may not want to use them, or may want something fully fledged

---

[.footer: arkivanov.github.io/Decompose]

## Decompose & Essenty
### 2021

^ Decompose focusses on the lifecycle awareness aspect with navigation included

^ Providing abstraction of platform lifecycle configuration changes and navigation

^ In the absence of ViewModel or LifecycleOwner did a good job of management

---

```kotlin
import com.arkivanov.decompose.ComponentContext

class DefaultRootComponent(
    componentContext: ComponentContext,
) : RootComponent, ComponentContext by componentContext {

    init {
        lifecycle... // Access the Lifecycle
        stateKeeper... // Access the StateKeeper
        instanceKeeper... // Access the InstanceKeeper
        backHandler... // Access the BackHandler
    }
}
```

^ Core principle of decompose is to provide multiplatform functionality through ComponentContext

^ Many functions here should be familiar to platfroms

^ Provides observability and value storage with lifecycle persistance

---

```kotlin
class RootComponent(context: ComponentContext) : Root, ComponentContext {
  private val navigation = StackNavigation<Config>()
  override val childStack = childStack(/* ... */)

  fun createChild(config: Config, context: ComponentContext): Child = when (config) {
    is Config.List -> Child.List(itemList(context))
    is Config.Details -> /* ... */
  }

  private fun itemList(context: ComponentContext): ItemList =
    ItemListComponent(context) { navigation.push(Config.Details(itemId = it)) }
}

private sealed class Config : Parcelable {
  @Parcelize object List : Config()
  @Parcelize data class Details(val itemId: Long) : Config()
}
```

^ For navigation it employs the concept of child stacks

^ Screen is created from the provided config

^ Not inherently compose, compose provided through extensions

---

# Decompose

- `com.arkivanov.decompose:extensions-compose`
- `com.arkivanov.decompose:extensions-android`
- `com.arkivanov.essenty:state-keeper`

^ Platform hosting capability exist in compose and android extensions

^ State keeper on darwin

---

Compose Multiplatform

^ Used to think Compose Multiplatform was doing some very clever repackaging of androidx releases

^ Actually a forked repo with the JetBrains team adapting libraries

^ Constant huge amount of work, incredible effort

---

Introduction of third party libraries with Compose or Multiplatform first ideology, inherit idiomatic style.

---

## Role of Architecture

^ Knowing that Compose runtime is capable of managing a tree of nodes

^ Means we can exploit this as an architecture

---

[.footer: github.com/slackhq/circuit]

## slackhq/circuit
### 2022

^ Circuit is a new Compose driven architecture for Android apps written by Zac and the folks at Slack

^ It‚Äôs a mechanism for handling navigation with @Parcelizable screens

---

- support for most KMP platforms now
- circuit-retained has become really powerful and sort of it's secret sauce. Works as a wormhole for managing state across the back stack and can even layer in with saveable
- https://chrisbanes.me/posts/retaining-beyond-viewmodels/
- CB has contributed a lot of clever features
- Lots of padded out functionality and features like multiple back stacks, navigation with results, expanded code gen support, circuitx artifacts

---

[.footer: voyager.adriel.cafe/]

## adriel/voyager
### 2021

---

Multiplatform issues with Android state management, parcelization/bundling of state parameters needs to be handled. Modern approaches should use Kotlin serialization.

---

Google recently made multiplatform a priority with moving a lot of dependencies to common, navigation included.

---

As of the time of writing, Jetpack Navigation is not yet multiplatform however it is offered as a JetBrains Compose Multiplatform artifact

---

Compose Multiplatform is usually quite delayed, JetBrains works hard on maintaining compatibility, but does not yet offer serialized destinations

---

Multiplatform documentation is difficult as it's out-of-date

---

Early adopters employed third party solutions, late adopters can migrate android navigation to multiplatform. The early bird got the worm, but the second mouse got the cheese.

---

```
* JetBrains Compose Multiplatform
```
