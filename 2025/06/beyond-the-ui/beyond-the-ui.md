# [fit] Beyond the UI

## [fit]Compose as a Foundation for Multiplatform Apps

#### mDevCamp - June '25 üá®üáø

^ Much in the same way that Coroutines revolutionized reactive architecture, Compose challenges us to rethink how we design applications. 

^ While traditionally seen as a UI toolkit, Compose ‚Äî and specifically Compose Multiplatform ‚Äî can play a much larger role in our applications.

^ By leveraging its declarative and state-driven nature, we can build, model, and manage application state in a way that is consistent, scalable, and platform-agnostic.

# What is Jetpack Compose UI

---

# When was Compose UI introduced?

---

- History of XML layouts in Android
- Android developers unhappy with XML

^ What problem was it trying to solve?

---

# What projects suggested a problem with the status quo?

- DataBinding & ViewBinding
- Community libraries (Anko, Splitties)

---

# What prompted a rethink of Android UI tooling?

- Widespread adoption of Kotlin on Android
- Kotlin language features

^ Kotlin language features, lambdas, immutability, extension functions

---

# What are the principles of Compose?

- Declarative
- Open Source
- Idiomatic

---

# How does it work?

- Kotlin compiler plugin
- Cooperation with Jetbrains
- Manipulates method signatures

---

# What does it look like?

```kotlin
@Composable
fun Counter() {
    var count by remember { mutableStateOf(0) }

    Button(onClick = { count += 1 }) {
        Text("Count: $count")
    }
}
```

> Compose is, at its core, a general-purpose tool for managing a tree of nodes of any type ... a ‚Äútree of nodes‚Äù describes just about anything, and as a result Compose can target just about anything.
-- Jake Wharton

^ What is Compose, at its core?

---

# [fit] ‚ö†Ô∏è Compose != Compose UI

---

# Kotlin Multiplatform
## Stable (1.9.20)

^ Kotlin Multiplatform, relatively new kid on the block

^ Stable from release 1.9.20 released on 1st Nov last year

^ But multiplatform isn‚Äôt a new concept‚Ä¶

---

# The Before Times

![75%](multiplatform-framework-logos.png)

^ There have been many attempts at multiplatform frameworks

^ Each demonstrating advantages and disadvantages

^ Some with limited success, some with even less

^ Some integrating the underlying OS some not

---

# The Before Times
![75%](multiplatform-languages.png)

^ Each framework specifying its own language and development / build environment

^ Whilst each of these languages have their own ecosystem of libraries etc

^ Not languages typically familiar to Android or mobile developers

^ Unless life has been particularly cruel to you

---

![80%](kotlin-multiplatform.jpg)

^ KMP starts small, doesn‚Äôt require sharing everything

^ Build components in a way that makes sense for you

^ Language already familiar to Android and backend developers

^ Strong community, public backing (JetBrains, Google)

---

# Compose Multiplatform üéâ

^ Enter Compose Multiplatform

---

![right](multiplatform-compose.svg)

# Compose Multiplatform
### v1.0 | 2021

^ Compose Multiplatform builds upon Kotlin multiplatform

^ Became ready for production with v1.0 at the end of 2021 (December)

^ Has since recategorised stability declarations

---

[.footer: github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform-core]

![75%](multiplatform-compose-core.png)

^ Imagined some very clever repackaging of androidx releases

^ Actually a forked repo with the JetBrains team adapting libraries

^ Constant huge amount of work, incredible effort

---

# Compose Multiplatform Migration

- Change artifact coordinates
- Do nothing
- Profit

^ If you're migrating from androidx navigation project

^ You've waited long enough to have androidx available

^ Congrats

---

[.code-highlight: 1, 11]

```kotlin
// Compiled Compose code

fun Counter($composer: Composer) { 
    $composer.startRestartGroup(-1913267612)
    
    /* ... */
    
    $composer.endRestartGroup()
}

// Compiled Coroutines code

fun counter($completion: Continuation) {
    /* ... */
}
```

^ Similarities between code manipulation

^ Consider how this can be used architecturally

---

# Remember the problems coroutines were meant to solve?

- Reactive pipelines
- Explicit thread handling
- Inline error-handling
- Lifecycle awareness

---

- Native library
- Imperative syntax
- `suspend fun`

^ What did Coroutines bring to the table?

---

# Reactive Architecture

- Push (not pull)
- Unidirectional Data Flow
- Declarative
- Idempotent

^ Consider our architecture goals and how we can use tooling to achieve them

---

```kotlin
downloadManager.downloadFile("https://.../") { result ->
  fileManager.saveFile("storage/file", result) { success ->
    if (success) println("Downloaded file successfully")
  }
}
```

^ Back in the day, we had callbacks, to execute code "after"

^ We still have this in a lot of places, which can be ok

^ Can quickly end up in callback hell

---

```kotlin
downloadManager.downloadFile("https://.../")
  .flatMap { result -> fileManager.saveFile("storage/file", result) }
  .observe { success -> if (success) println("Downloaded file successfully") }
```

^ Which then evolved into an observable chain

^ Everything is a stream, and it's observable

^ Can quickly become unmanagable with Rx operators

---

```kotlin
val file = downloadFile("https://.../")
val success = fileManager.saveFile("storage/file", file)
if (success) println("Downloaded file successfully")
```

^ Coroutines turned this into an imperative style

^ Get to enjoy Kotlin and structured concurrency

---

```kotlin
downloadManager.downloadFile("https://.../")
  .flatMapLatest { state ->
    when (state) {
      is State.Loaded -> stateFileManager.saveFile("storage/file", state.value)
      else -> state
    }
  }
  .collect { state ->
    when (state) {
      is State.Loading -> /* ... */
      is State.Saved -> println("Downloaded file successfully")
    }
  }
```

^ TODO Expand on these code segments link each better

^ Consider though that we wish to model our state through a reactive flow

^ Which through Coroutines looks similar to observables

---

```mermaid
%%{ init: { 'flowchart': { 'curve': 'stepBefore' } } }%%
flowchart TD
    RN1[RootNode] --> CN1[ChildNode]
    RN1[RootNode] --> CN2[ChildNode]
    RN1[RootNode] --> CN3[ChildNode]
    RN1[RootNode] --> CN4[ChildNode]
    RN1[RootNode] --> CN5[ChildNode]
    CN1[ChildNode] --> CN6[ChildNode]
    CN1[ChildNode] --> CN7[ChildNode]
    CN5[ChildNode] --> CN8[ChildNode]
    CN5[ChildNode] --> CN10[ChildNode]
    CN10[ChildNode] --> CN11[ChildNode]
    CN10[ChildNode] --> CN12[ChildNode]
```

^ Remembering that Compose is a tree of nodes means we can restructure our architecture

---

```kotlin
val downloadState = downloadManager
    .downloadFile("https://.../")
    .collectAsState(State.Loading)

val fileState = when(downloadState) {
  is State.Loaded -> stateFileManager.saveFile("storage/file", state.value)
  else -> state
}

when (fileState) {
  is State.Loading -> /* ... */
  is State.Saved -> LaunchedEffect(fileState) {
    println("Downloaded file successfully")
  }
}
```

^ Means we've moved changed the react operators into a more readable sequence of declarations

---

# Molecule
### github.com/cashapp/molecule

^ Molecule built by the folks at Square explores this further

^ Being able to use Compose runtime to build a state

---

## Molecule

```kotlin
fun CoroutineScope.launchCounter(): StateFlow<Int> {
  return launchMolecule(mode = ContextClock) {
    var count by remember { mutableStateOf(0) }

    LaunchedEffect(Unit) {
      while (true) {
        delay(1_000)
        count++
      }
    }

    count
  }
}
```

^ Utilising Compose Runtime to build state flow

---

# Testing

```kotlin
@Test 
fun counter() = runTest {
  moleculeFlow(RecompositionMode.Immediate) {
    Counter()
  }.test {
    assertEquals(0, awaitItem())
    assertEquals(1, awaitItem())
    assertEquals(2, awaitItem())
    cancel()
  }
}
```

^ Combine molecule with Turbine to test a composable as a flow

---

# Turbine
## `app.cash.turbine:turbine:1.2.0`

---

# Turbine

```kotlin
flowOf("one", "two").test {
  assertEquals("one", awaitItem())
  assertEquals("two", awaitItem())
  awaitComplete()
}
```

---

## Role of Architecture

^ Knowing that Compose runtime is capable of managing a tree of nodes

^ Means we can exploit this as an architecture

^ TODO: Importance of navigation and architecture

---

## Pre-Compose Era

^ Taking frameworks and applying them to compose works fine

^ But if it seems a little un-idiomatic

^ Consider Compose first architectures

---

# Tooling in Compose MPP

- üîß Decompose (Navigation, Lifecycle)
- üß¨ Molecule (State modeling)
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Circuit (Navigation, State management)
- ü™û Voyager / Appyx (Navigation alternatives)
- üåà Kamel (Image loading)
- üß™ Paparazzi / Snapshot testing (UI validation)

---

# Navigation with Decompose

- Declarative component hierarchy
- State hoisting via ViewModels (multiplatform-friendly)
- Back stack management without fragments
- Integration with Compose UI and Compose for Web/Desktop

^ TODO Example Diagram or snippet optional

---

# Circuit
## github.com/slackhq/circuit

^ Circuit is a community contributed library for multiplatform

^ Takes inspiration from existing approaches, cashapp broadway, workflow etc

---

## Circuit

- Supports most supported KMP platforms
- Compose first architecture
- Presenter & UI separation
- Unidirectional Data Flow

^ Designed with Compose in mind, powered with the compose runtime

^ Same principal tenet, separation of presenter and ui

^ UDF all the way through, no mutability

---

# Why Compose Multiplatform?

^ Let‚Äôs explore what makes Compose Multiplatform a compelling option.

---

## Shared UI Logic

- Write once, run on Android, Desktop, iOS, Web
- Avoid duplicating presentation logic

^ Compose MPP lets you reuse your UI structure and state logic across platforms ‚Äî not just styles or themes.

---

## Unified State Handling

- Share ViewModels or Presenters across platforms
- Keep logic and state in sync across UIs

^ This makes platform-specific behaviour easier to isolate, and core app logic easier to test.

---

## Fast Prototyping

- Quickly ship UI to multiple form factors
- Desktop becomes a testbed for mobile UIs

^ You can validate ideas on desktop or Android before touching iOS ‚Äî great for iteration and feedback.

---

## Compose Beyond Visual UI

- Not just visual layout
- Great for business logic and reactive workflows

^ Composables can manage more than what‚Äôs on screen ‚Äî think domain state, user flows, or FSMs.

---

# What Compose MPP Enables

^ Let‚Äôs go one level deeper ‚Äî what Compose Multiplatform *unlocks* for your architecture.

---

## Consistent State Patterns

- Hoisting, unidirectional data flow
- Shared reactive state handling

^ Patterns like UDF become even more powerful when applied the same way across every platform.

---

## Shared Design System

- Material components
- Typography, spacing, theming ‚Äî once

^ You can maintain a consistent design language across all platforms without custom wrappers.

---

## IDE-First Experience

- JetBrains tools tightly integrated
- Live previews and navigation supported

^ With JetBrains behind Compose for Desktop and IntelliJ, tooling is first-class.

---

## Kotlin Multiplatform Ecosystem

- Compose integrates easily with:
  - `Ktor` for networking
  - `Kotlinx.serialization` for models
  - `Decompose`, `Essenty` for navigation/state

^ Compose fits naturally into the Kotlin Multiplatform world ‚Äî no hacks or bridges needed.

---

# Compose Runtime Beyond UI

^ The power of Compose isn‚Äôt limited to visuals ‚Äî it‚Äôs a reactive runtime at heart.

---

## Composables Are Reactive Functions

- Input = State
- Output = UI + Side-effects

^ This pure functional approach makes Composables ideal for modeling any stateful behaviour.

---

## Ideal Use Cases

- Finite State Machines
- Flow Orchestration
- Deterministic State Testing

^ If you‚Äôve got a flow or state machine, Compose can represent and drive it ‚Äî testably and predictably.
  
---

# Wrap-Up: Why This Matters

‚úÖ Compose is more than a UI toolkit  
‚úÖ Enables scalable, shared architecture  
‚úÖ Designed for Kotlin-first developers  
‚úÖ Multiplatform is no longer just business logic

‚Üí Start rethinking how you architect apps, not just how you render them.
