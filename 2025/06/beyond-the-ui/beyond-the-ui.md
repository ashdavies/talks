# [fit] Beyond the UI

## [fit]Compose as a Foundation for Multiplatform Apps

^ Much in the same way that Coroutines revolutionized reactive architecture, Compose challenges us to rethink how we design applications. 

^ While traditionally seen as a UI toolkit, Compose ‚Äî and specifically Compose Multiplatform ‚Äî can play a much larger role in our applications.

^ By leveraging its declarative and state-driven nature, we can build, model, and manage application state in a way that is consistent, scalable, and platform-agnostic.

---

^ What is Jetpack Compose UI

---

^ When was Compose UI introduced?

---

- History of XML layouts in Android
- Android developers unhappy with XML

^ What problem was it trying to solve?

---

- DataBinding & ViewBinding
- Community libraries (Anko, Splitties)

^ What projects suggested a problem with the status quo?

---

Widespread adoption of Kotlin on Android

^ What prompted a rethink of Android UI tooling?

---

- Declarative
- Open Source
- Idiomatic

^ What are the principles of Compose?

---

- Kotlin compiler plugin
- Cooperation with Jetbrains
- Manipulates method signatures

^ How does it work?

---

```kotlin
@Composable
fun Counter() {
    var count by remember { mutableStateOf(0) }

    Button(onClick = { count += 1 }) {
        Text("Count: $count")
    }
}
```

^ What does it look like?

---

[.code-highlight: 1]

```kotlin
fun Counter($composer: Composer) { 
    $composer.startRestartGroup(-1913267612)
    
    /* ... */
    
    $composer.endRestartGroup()
}
```

^ What does this code remind us of?

---

```kotlin
fun counter($completion: Continuation) {
    /* ... */
}
```

^ How is the KotlinX Coroutine code manipulation similar?

> Compose is, at its core, a general-purpose tool for managing a tree of nodes of any type ... a ‚Äútree of nodes‚Äù describes just about anything, and as a result Compose can target just about anything.
-- Jake Wharton

^ What is Compose, at its core?

---

# [fit] ‚ö†Ô∏è Compose != Compose UI

^ What is Compose, not?

[.code-highlight: 1]

```kotlin
fun Counter($composer: Composer) { 
    $composer.startRestartGroup(-1913267612)
    
    /* ... */
    
    $composer.endRestartGroup()
}
