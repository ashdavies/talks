# Jetpack Compose UI
### github.com/androidx/androidx/tree/androidx-main/compose/ui

![right 25%](jetpack-compose-logo.png)

^ What is Jetpack Compose UI, if unfamiliar to Android

---

[.background-color: ##2b2b2b]
[.footer-style: #333]

```kotlin
@Composable
fun JetpackCompose() {
    Card {
        var expanded by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }
        Column(Modifier.clickable { expanded = !expanded }) {
            Image(painterResource(R.drawable.jetpack_compose))
            AnimatedVisibility(expanded) {
                Text(
                    text = "Jetpack Compose",
                    style = MaterialTheme.typography.bodyLarge,
                )
            }
        }
    }
}
```

^ Though Compose UI was announced at Google IO 2019

^ Didn't reach stable release until 2021

---

# Compose UI

- Declarative UI Framework
- Open Source Kotlin
- Accelerate UI development
- Intuitive Idiomatic API

^ Exploit Kotlin DSL language idioms

---

# Android Layouts

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<LinearLayout xmlns:android=
"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
  android:layout_width="match_parent"
  android:layout_height="match_parent"
android:orientation="vertical" >

  <TextView android:id="@+id/text"
  android:layout_width="wrap_content"
  android:layout_height="wrap_content"
  android:text="Hello, I am a TextView" />
  
<Button android:id="@+id/button"
  android:layout_width="wrap_content"
  android:layout_height="wrap_content"
  android:text="Hello, I am a Button" />

</LinearLayout>
```

![right fill 75%](layout-params.png)

^ Android has a rich a colourful history with layouts

^ Views written in XML, painful to structure

^ Inflated at runtime, poor attribute attestation

^ Years of optimisations, performance acceptable

---

# Android Layouts
### Lifecycle

![right](viewmodel-lifecycle.png)

^ Also introduced the problem of lifecycle management

^ The bane of every Android developers existence

---

# Tooling

![inline fill](android-databinding.png)![inline fill](kotlin-anko.png)
![inline fill](android-view-binding.png)![inline fill](splitties.png)

^ Additional tooling developed by Google and OS community

^ Made some aspects bearable

---

# XML?!

![right](kotti-cat-wut.jpeg)

^ Kotlin has spoilt us, nobody wants to use XML anymore

---

# Android Layouts and Compose

- Widespread adoption of Kotlin on Android
- Idiomatic Kotlin language features

^ Kotlin language features, lambdas, immutability, extension functions

^ Kotlin DSLs apply naturally to the view hierarchy

---

# Jetpack Compose UI 
## Principles

- Composition > Inheritance
- Declarative Syntax
- Immutable State
- Recomposition

^ More on recomposition later

---

# Jetpack Compose UI
## Under-the-hood

![right](gap-buffer-structure.webp)

- Kotlin compiler plugin
- Gap buffer data structure

^ Collaborating with JetBrains to exploit the Kotlin Compiler Plugin API

^ Transforms method signatures to inject a composer

^ Composer uses gap buffer to build a node structure

---

# Jetpack Compose UI
## Talk is Cheap

```kotlin
@Composable
fun Counter() {
    var count by remember { mutableStateOf(0) }

    Button(onClick = { count += 1 }) {
        Text("Count: $count")
    }
}
```

> Compose is, at its core, a general-purpose tool for managing a tree of nodes of any type ... a “tree of nodes” describes just about anything, and as a result Compose can target just about anything.
-- Jake Wharton

^ What is Compose, at its core?

---

# [fit] ⚠️ Compose != Compose UI

---

# Kotlin Multiplatform
## Stable (1.9.20)

^ Kotlin Multiplatform, relatively new kid on the block

^ Stable from release 1.9.20 released on 1st Nov last year

^ But multiplatform isn’t a new concept…

---

# The Before Times

![75%](multiplatform-framework-logos.png)

^ There have been many attempts at multiplatform frameworks

^ Each demonstrating advantages and disadvantages

^ Some with limited success, some with even less

^ Some integrating the underlying OS some not

---

# The Before Times
![75%](multiplatform-languages.png)

^ Each framework specifying its own language and development / build environment

^ Whilst each of these languages have their own ecosystem of libraries etc

^ Not languages typically familiar to Android or mobile developers

^ Unless life has been particularly cruel to you

---

![80%](kotlin-multiplatform.jpg)

^ KMP starts small, doesn’t require sharing everything

^ Build components in a way that makes sense for you

^ Language already familiar to Android and backend developers

^ Strong community, public backing (JetBrains, Google)

---

![right](multiplatform-compose.svg)

# Compose Multiplatform
### v1.0 | 2021

^ Compose Multiplatform builds upon Kotlin multiplatform

^ Became ready for production with v1.0 at the end of 2021 (December)

^ Has since recategorised stability declarations

---

[.footer: github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform-core]

![75% corner-radius(16)](compose-multiplatform-core.png)

^ Imagined some very clever repackaging of androidx releases

^ Actually a forked repo with the JetBrains team adapting libraries

^ Constant huge amount of work, incredible effort

---

# Compose Multiplatform Migration

- Change artifact coordinates
- Do nothing
- Profit

^ If you're migrating from androidx navigation project

^ You've waited long enough to have androidx available

^ Congrats

    /* ... */
    
    $composer.endRestartGroup()
}

// Compiled Coroutines code

fun counter($completion: Continuation) {
    /* ... */
}
```

^ Similarities between code manipulation

^ Consider how this can be used architecturally

---

# KotlinX Coroutines

^ Remember the problems coroutines were meant to solve?

```kotlin
@Suppress("DEPRECATION")
class CallbackLoginPresenter(
  private val service: SessionService,
  private val goTo: (Screen) -> Unit,
) {
  /* ... */

  inner class LoginAsyncTask : AsyncTask<Submit,Void,LoginResult>() {

    override fun doInBackground(vararg events: Submit?): LoginResult {
      val event = events[0]!!
      username = event.username
      return runBlocking { service.login(event.username, event.password) }

        is Failure -> goTo(ErrorScreen(result.throwable?.message ?: ""))
        else -> {}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

^ Much like layouts, Android has a troubled past with asynchronous operations

---

[.footer: proandroiddev.com/how-rxjava-chain-actually-works-2800692f7e13]

```kotlin
Observable.just("Hey")
    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
    .map(String::length)
    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.computation())
    .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
    .doOnSubscribe { doAction() }
    .flatMap {
        doAction()

        Observable.timer(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
            .subscribeOn(Schedulers.single())
            .doOnSubscribe { doAction() }
    }
    .subscribe { doAction() }
```

^ Over-utilisation of mapping operations increases cognitive load

^ Requiring intimate knowledge of the framework to be productive

---

# KotlinX Coroutines

- Lightweight memory usage
- Structured concurrency
- Cancellation propagation
- Lifecycle aware

^ A single thread can support many Coroutines

^ Structured concurrency scopes resources and helps prevent leaks

^ Built in cancellation support propagates through the hierarchy

^ Lifecycle aware operation through JetPack extensions

^ TODO Break up slides

---

# KotlinX Coroutines

- Native library
- Imperative syntax
- `suspend fun`

^ Furthermore being a native library was able to exploit Kotlin langauge functions

^ Write imperative code that behaves as reactive

---

# Reactive Architecture

- Push (not pull)
- Unidirectional Data Flow
- Declarative
- Idempotent

^ Consider our architecture goals and how we can use tooling to achieve them

---

```kotlin
downloadManager
    .downloadFile("https://.../")
    .addOnCompletionListener { result ->
        fileManager
            .saveFile("storage/file", result)
            .addOnCompletionListener { success ->
                if (success) {
                    println("Downloaded file successfully")
                }
            }
    }
}
```

^ Back in the day, we had callbacks, to execute code "after"

^ We still have this in a lot of places, which can be ok

^ Can quickly end up in callback hell

---

[.code-highlight: 3-10]

```kotlin
downloadManager
    .downloadFile("https://.../")
    .flatMap { result -> 
        fileManager.saveFile("storage/file", result)
    }
    .observe { success ->
        if (success) {
            println("Downloaded file successfully")
        }
    }
```

^ Which then evolved into an observable chain

^ Everything is a stream, and it's observable

^ Can quickly become unmanagable with Rx operators

---

```kotlin
val file = downloadFile("https://.../")
val success = fileManager.saveFile("storage/file", file)

if (success) {
    println("Downloaded file successfully")
}
```

^ Coroutines turned this into an imperative style

^ Get to enjoy Kotlin and structured concurrency

^ Reduces complexity to top level

---

[.code-highlight: 12-31]
![left](kotti-question.jpg)

```kotlin
- downloadManager
-   .downloadFile("https://.../")
-   .flatMap { result ->
-     fileManager.saveFile("storage/file", result)
-   }
-   .observe { success ->
-     if (success) {
-       println("Downloaded file successfully")
-     }
-   }

+ downloadManager.
+     downloadFile("https://.../")
+     .flatMapLatest { state ->
+         when (state) {
+             is State.Loaded -> 
+                 stateFileManager
+                     .saveFile("storage/file", state.value)
+             
+           else -> state
+         }
+     }
+     .collect { state ->
+         when (state) {
+           is State.Saved -> 
+               println("Downloaded file successfully")

+           is State.Loading ->
+               /* ... */
+         }
+     }
```

^ Suspended functions are one shot operations, sometimes you need a reactive flow

^ Besides an improved sealed class event structure, pretty much the same as Rx

^ Remembering that Compose is a tree of nodes means we can restructure our architecture

---

val downloadState = downloadManager
    .downloadFile("https://.../")
    .collectAsState(State.Downloading)

val fileState = when(downloadState) {
    is State.Loaded -> 
        stateFileManager
            .saveFile("storage/file", downloadState.value)
    else -> downloadState
}

when (fileState) {
    is State.Loading -> /* ... */
        
    is State.Saved -> LaunchedEffect(fileState) {
        println("Downloaded file successfully")
    }
}
```

^ Operations are idiomatic, readable, low cognitive load

    Counter()
  }.test {
    assertEquals(0, awaitItem())
    assertEquals(1, awaitItem())

^ Means we can exploit this as an architecture

---

# [fit] Navigation 🗺️

![35% corner-radius(16)](slackhq-circuit.png)
![75%](decompose-logo.png)

^ Worth noting how similar navigation and architecture is

^ Navigation is such an essential part of the structure

---

[.footer: android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/05/announcing-jetpack-navigation-3-for-compose.html]

# [fit] Jetpack Navigation 3

![](jetpack-navigation-compose.png)

^ Earlier this month Google announced Jetpack Navigation 3

^ Promising to solve problems with canonical layouts

^ Compose first design, let's see...

---

# [fit] Pre-Compose Era 🪨

^ Taking frameworks and applying them to compose works fine

^ But if it seems a little un-idiomatic

^ Consider Compose first architectures

---

# Tooling in Compose MPP

- 🔧 Decompose (Navigation, Lifecycle)
- 🧬 Molecule (State modeling)
- ⚡️ Circuit (Navigation, State management)
- 🪞 Voyager / Appyx (Navigation alternatives)
- 🌈 Kamel (Image loading)
- 🧪 Paparazzi / Snapshot testing (UI validation)

---

## Decompose & Essenty
### arkivanov.github.io/Decompose

^ Decompose focusses on the lifecycle awareness aspect with navigation included

^ Providing abstraction of platform lifecycle configuration changes and navigation

^ In the absence of ViewModel or LifecycleOwner did a good job of management

---

```kotlin
import com.arkivanov.decompose.ComponentContext

class DefaultRootComponent(
    componentContext: ComponentContext,
) : RootComponent, ComponentContext by componentContext {

    init {
        lifecycle... // Access the Lifecycle
        stateKeeper... // Access the StateKeeper
        instanceKeeper... // Access the InstanceKeeper
        backHandler... // Access the BackHandler
    }
}
```

^ Core principle of decompose is to provide multiplatform functionality through ComponentContext

^ Many functions here should be familiar to platforms

^ Provides observability and value storage with lifecycle persistence

---

[.footer: github.com/slackhq/circuit]

![75% corner-radius(16)](slackhq-circuit.png)

^ Circuit is a community contributed library for multiplatform

^ Takes inspiration from existing approaches, cashapp broadway, workflow etc

---

## Circuit

- Supports most supported KMP platforms
- Compose first architecture
- Presenter & UI separation
- Unidirectional Data Flow

^ Designed with Compose in mind, powered with the compose runtime

^ Same principal tenet, separation of presenter and ui

^ UDF all the way through, no mutability

---

```kotlin
@Parcelize
data object CounterScreen : Screen { 
    data class CounterState(
        val count: Int, 
        val eventSink: (CounterEvent) -> Unit,
    ) : CircuitUiState
  
    sealed interface CounterEvent : CircuitUiEvent {
        data object Increment : CounterEvent
    }
}

@Composable
fun CounterPresenter(): CounterState {
    var count by rememberSaveable { mutableStateOf(0) }

    return CounterState(count) { event ->
        when (event) {
            CounterEvent.Increment -> count++
        }
    }
}

@Composable
fun Counter(state: CounterState) {
    Column(Modifier.align(Alignment.Center)) {
        Text(text = "Count: ${state.count}")
      
        Button(onClick = { state.eventSink(CounterEvent.Increment) }) {
            Icon(rememberVectorPainter(Icons.Filled.Add), "Increment")
        }
    }
}
```

# Why Compose Multiplatform?

^ Let’s explore what makes Compose Multiplatform a compelling option.

^ TODO Recomposition, strong skipping, automatic invalidation

^ TODO Downsides: remember not default, must consider expensive computations

^ TODO rememberSaveable()

---

[.background-color:#fff]

![100%](platform-logos.png)

^ Write once, run on Android, Desktop, iOS, Web

^ Avoid duplicating presentation logic

^ Keep logic and state in sync across UIs

^ Compiles natively

---

# Prototyping 🚀

^ Quickly ship UI to multiple form factors

^ Desktop becomes a testbed for mobile UIs

---

[.footer: github.com/JetBrains/compose-hot-reload]

![inline](compose-hot-reload.png)

^ With minimal setup you can use Compose Hot Reload

^ Near instantaneous UI feedback

---

# Recomposition 🔄

^ Compose skips execution where it's not necessary

^ Performance is improved when state is unchanged

---

# Remember 🧠

^ Compose remember introduced as a concept

^ Whilst allowing fine grained control

^ Requires some forethought

---

# Remember 🧠

```kotlin
var path by remember { mutableStateOf("https://.../") }
val file = remember(path) {
    downloadManager.downloadFile(path)
}
```

^ When the value of path changes, the file will be downloaded

^ This won't be retained through configuration change or process death

^ Not a novel problem, we have this problem already

---

# Remember 🧠

```kotlin
var path by remember { mutableStateOf("https://.../") }
val file = rememberSaveable(path) {
    // Must be Parcelable on Android!
    downloadManager.downloadFile(path)
}
```

^ Value must be primitive or Parcelable

---

# Circuit

# `rememberRetained()`

^ Circuit introduces the concept of retained state

^ Retained stored in memory, persists configuration change

---

[.footer: chrisbanes.me/posts/retaining-beyond-viewmodels]

![](retaining-beyond-viewmodels-background.jpg)

## `rememberRetainedCoroutineScope()`
### Retaining Beyond ViewModels

^ Chris covers this in detail with retaining a CoroutineScope

^ Perform long running operations

---

## Consistent State Patterns

- Hoisting, unidirectional data flow
- Shared reactive state handling

^ Patterns like UDF become even more powerful when applied the same way across every platform.

---

## Shared Design System

- Material components
- Typography, spacing, theming — once

^ You can maintain a consistent design language across all platforms without custom wrappers.

---

## IDE-First Experience

- JetBrains tools tightly integrated
- Live previews and navigation supported

^ With JetBrains behind Compose for Desktop and IntelliJ, tooling is first-class.

---

# Wrap-Up: Why This Matters

✅ Compose is more than a UI toolkit  
✅ Enables scalable, shared architecture  
✅ Designed for Kotlin-first developers  
✅ Multiplatform is no longer just business logic

→ Start rethinking how you architect apps, not just how you render them.
