# [fit] Crafting Idiomatic APIs with Kotlin and Compose

## Droidcon Berlin - September '25 üá©üá™

![inline right](kotti-sticker.webp)

---

# What is an API?

```shell
curl --request GET \
  --url "https://api.github.com/octocat" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN" \
  --header "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28"
```

^ May think API are exclusively about retrieving data from rest services online

^ Anything that uses a programming language to interface with another application

---

## Protocols

### SOAP / Rest / GraphQL / gRPC

^ Protocols define a mechanism for communication, wire protocols

^ Slightly nuanced, still include specification for APIs

---

## SDKs üì¶

^ SDKs often built upon existing public APIs to aid developers

^ Help introduce language features across protocols

^ Firebase, Google Services, etc

---

## "Ordinary" Code

^ Code that you might produce in your day job

^ That mundane feature, bug fix, etc

---

# Everything is an API
### Droidcon Berlin - Oct 21'

---

## Unit Tests

^ Unit tests are production code that doesn't ship

^ Tests verify Production code, need to be understandable

---

## Temporary Code

^ Under pressure, time constraints, should temporary code by considered an API?

---

> There is nothing more permanent than a temporary solution

^ Perhaps short lived code doesn't need to be perfect?

---

# Who is your API for?

^ API design is fundamentally a consideration to the consumer

^ What tools do they have at their disposal?

---

## Consumers

^ Maybe you're an SDK or framework developer

^ Your code is used by other developers

^ Consider their requirements

---

## Colleagues

^ Your code will likely be peer-reviewed

^ Once you push, your code is no longer yours

---

## Future Self

^ No scenario where your code will not be used by someone else

^ Even if that somebody else is you

---

## Consequences

^ Consequences of poorly designed APIs

---

## Consequences

### Job security

---

## Consequences

### Increased learning curve ü§î

^ Revisiting your code might take longer to understand requirements

^ Takes longer for new developers to understand, can be misleading

---

## Consequences

### Longer peer review

---

## Consequences

### Slowed feature delivery üí∞

^ Slow feature delivery increases your time to market

^ Actual fiscal effect on running a business

^ Code has a continued maintenance cost

---

# Idiomatic

^ What does it mean to be idiomatic?

---

## Idioms
### kotlinlang.org/docs/idioms.html

^ Might be familiar with idioms in spoken language

^ Break a leg, bite the bullet, have your cake and eat it too

^ Carry meaning not obvious from the use of words

^ Scope functions, immutability, destructuring, when statements

^ Really just about using language features appropriately

---

# Language üó£Ô∏è

^ Over 7k languages being spoken today, with dialects, hundreds of thousands

^ Countless languages to program with, kindly the Americans have offered theirs...

---

# üá∫üá∏

![right](grace-hopper.jpg)

^ Worlds first programming languages written by American mathematicians and scientists, in English.

^ Grace Hopper, arguably the mother of modern programming languages.

---

# colo~~u~~r

^ To this day programming is written in Simplified English, much to my chagrin

```mermaid
xychart-beta horizontal
    x-axis [Luxemburg, Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, Austria, Germany, Poland, UK]
    y-axis "Average number of languages spoken per person in Europe" 0 --> 4
    bar [3.6, 3.2, 2.8, 2.6, 2.2, 2, 1.8, 0.6]

```

^ Average European speaks two or more languages

^ Not to mention business-specific terminology

---


```kotlin
fun showCancelBookingAndBackToVerbindungsuebersichtDialog()

fun handleLoadBuchungskundenDatenOrOpenRechnungFailure()

fun getAngebotsKonditionIconAndContentDescription()
```

^ Not uncommon for code to include words from other languages

^ eg. "Bahnhof", "Betriebstelle", "Zug storniert wegen Signalst√∂rung"

# Teuton: Eine Deutsche Programmiersprache

```python
# -*- coding: iso-8859-1 -*-

sch√∂n = Wahr
h√§√ülich = Falsch

f√ºr b√§h in [sch√∂n, h√§√ülich]:
    drucke b√§h

def sovielwiem√∂glich():
    "gib"
    zur√ºck "was mir geh√∂rt"
```

^ Not to say that all programming languages should be English

^ Best to reduce the number of languages

^ TODO Number of native German speaking programmers in Germany

---

## Business Specific Terminology

^ You might find business specific terminology in your code

^ Because this relates to the domain, inherent to business

---

## Stornierung, Ersatzverkehr, Signalst√∂rung...

### Business Specific Terminology

^ AKA I've been living here too long
