Why do we test?
Why do we replace mocks? (Remove IO operations in unit tests for performance)

Test code is just production code that doesn't ship

There is always a way!
This is the way.

Use Case: Verifying functions without a return type
Solution: Verify domain state, or use a fake.

Testing approaches, benefits of unit tests
Unit tests for stability, structured code.
Importance of unit testing

Scenarios:
Change of method signature
Change of interface contract
Narrowing type inheritance
Mockito type safety
Default return types

Forces interface segregation
Alternatives to mocking?
Fakes, Stubs, Concretions

Fake, concrete implementation of interface, written with the production code, provides better documentation, insight, into the purpose of behaviour.

# Beyond the Mockery
## Ash Davies

---

# Legacy 
## adj.

Denoting or relating to software or hardware that has been superseded but is difficult to replace because of its wide use.

^ When inheriting a legacy project, it can be tough to know where to start.

---

# Beyond the Mockery: Why Test?

- üëÄ Awareness
- üèó Architecture
- üí™ Confidence
- üìñ Documentation
- üíØ Stability

^ Awareness: Writing test code at the same time as code that ships gives you a better perspective of edge cases

^ Architecture: Poor code is often synonymous with poor architecture, and poor testability.

^ Confidence: Confidence in your tests, means confidence in your code, and confidence in refactoring.

^ Documentation: Tests documentation often provides better insight into the purpose of domain behaviour.

^ Stability: Well written unit tests provide robust protection, and early feedback, against regressions.

---

# Beyond the Mockery
## Testing

^ Not the goal of this talk to convince you to write tests, but to convince you to write better tests.

![original 35%](fixing-unit-tests.png)

^ Fixing unit tests can often feel like navigating a minefield, in the dark, with a blindfold on.

^ The history of a test can be difficult to follow, and the code can be difficult to understand.

^ The tests themselves can be difficult to run, and the results can be difficult to interpret.

---

# Anti-Patterns and Code Smell

^ It's not until we start writing tests that we realise how difficult it is to test our code.

^ This is often a sign that our code is not structured well.

---

# Extreme Programming ü§ò
## Test-Driven Development

^ Let to the consideration of "extreme" programming practices like test driven development.

^ Taking an extreme approach to testing, and writing tests before writing code.

^ Tested code is often more structured, with lower cognitive load, and easier to understand.

> Debugging is like being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer.
-- Filipe Fortes

^ Often git blame will reveal the suspect, which is quite often me.

# Kotlin
## noun

Awesome.

^ The guiding principle of Kotlin is to make it easy for engineers to write good, safe code.

^ By making it gradually more difficult to write bad code!

^ Primary tenet of that is the concept of mutability.

---

# Kotlin: Mutability
## Risks of Mutation

^ What is mutability, and what are the risks of mutation?

---

# Kotlin: Mutability
## Risks of Mutation

```kotlin
fun sumAbsolute(list: MutableList<Int>): Int {
  for (i in list.indices) list[i] = abs(list[i])
  return list.sum()
}
```

^ Consider the following code, this mutates the list directly in-place.

^ Impure function, results in an non-deterministic state, hard to predict.

---

# Kotlin: Mutability
## Risks of Mutation

```kotlin
private val GROUNDHOG_DAY = TODO("java.util.Date()")
fun startOfSpring(): java.util.Date = GROUNDHOG_DAY

val partyDate = startOfSpring()
partyDate.month = partyDate.month + 1

// Date is mutable ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
```

^ Another shared mutable state example, this time with a date.

^ The Date class is mutable, and can be changed by any other class.

---

# Kotlin: Mutability
## Shared Mutable State ‚ö†Ô∏è

^ Shared mutable state is the root of all evil.

---

# Kotlin: Immutability
## Unidirectional Data Flow üèÜ

^ Unidirectional data flow is a pattern that is used in many modern frameworks.

^ Its a great way of ensuring a predictable state, where date flows in one direction.

^ Easier to find bugs, replay events, predict application state.

---

# Kotlin: Immutability
## Collections

```kotlin
fun Map<K, V>.toMutableMap(): MutableMap<K, V>
fun List<T>.toMutableList(): MutableList<T>
```

^ One of the mechanisms Kotlin uses to encourage immutability is to provide separate types.

^ The immutable types can be converted to mutable types, which produce a new copy.

---

# Kotlin: Immutability
## IntelliJ IDEA

![right](intellij-mutable-variables.png)

^ IntelliJ formats code even to highlight mutable variables as underlined.

^ This subconscious "encouragement" makes the variable look "out-of-place"

---

# Kotlin: Immutability
## Final Concretions üß±

By default, Kotlin classes are final ‚Äì they can't be inherited

```kotlin
open class Base // Class is open for inheritance
```

^ Finally, and most importantly, Kotlin makes all classes final by default.
                                                                                                                                         
^ Encourages composition over inheritance, enabling powerful delegation patterns.

^ Kotlin classes can be made open, but this is a conscious decision.

---

# Kotlin: Immutability
## All-Open Compiler Plugin

`org.jetbrains.kotlin.plugin.allopen`

^ For circumstances where open classes are required, the all-open plugin can be used.

^ Though the documentation implies this is meant for use with frameworks such as Spring AOP.

---

# üßµ Seams

^ A seam is a place where you can separate behaviour in your program without editing in that place.

^ Often achieved with interfaces, or abstract classes.

---

# üßµ Seams
## Preprocessing

- Kotlin Symbol Processing
- Kotlin Compiler Plugins

^ Preprocessed seams make use of earlier processing steps prior to compilation.

^ Whilst this is widely supported in Kotlin with KSP and Compiler Plugins (see Compose), it is rarely used for this purpose.

^ This mechanism is unruly due to poor code clarity, but allows for sensing without modifying code.

---

# üßµ Seams
## Linking: Classpath

```kotlin
import fit.Parser

internal class FitFilter {
  private val parser: Parser =
    Parser.newInstance()
}
```

^ When classes are imported the Java virtual machine uses the classpath environment variable.

^ You could then override the classpath with your own implementation for specific classes.

---

# üßµ Seams
## Linking: Classpath

```kotlin
buildscript {
    dependencies {
        val googleServicesVersion = libs.versions.google.services.get()
        classpath("com.google.gms:google-services:$googleServicesVersion")
    }
}
```

^ You will have already configured the classpath in your project using plugins

---

# üßµ Seams
## Objects

```kotlin
internal class FitFilter {
  private val parser: Parser =
    Parser.newInstance()
}
```

^ Objects are the most useful seam, as they allow for the replacement of behaviour without modifying code.

^ This is also the most common type of refactoring, as it utilising the existing compiler configuration.

---

# üßµ Seams
## Objects: Refactoring

![right](intellij-refactor-overlay.png)

[.code-highlight: 1-4, 10-12]

```kotlin
+ internal fun interface FitFilter {
+   fun filter(input: String): String
+ }
+ 
- internal class FitFilter {
-   private val parser: Parser =
-     Parser.newInstance()
- }
- 
+ internal fun FitFilter(parser: Parser) = FitFilter { input ->
+   parser.parse(input)
+ }
```

^ Requires modern refactoring techniques, and a good understanding of idomatic code.

^ Thankfully IntelliJ offers a lot of support for this, and it's often as simple as a few clicks.

# Testing: Android
## Legacy Inheritance

![right 15%](green-robot.png)

^ Like many frameworks and platforms, Android has a long history of legacy code.

^ Advances in Jetpack, AndroidX, and Project Mainline have improved this.

^ Still framework code to deal with.

---

# android.content.Context

![right](android-context-structure.png)

^ The Android context is considered by many to be a "god object"

---

# ü™Ω God Objects

^ God objects often reference a large number of distinct types, and/or unrelated methods.

^ Since they command so much, it's difficult to provide alternative implementations.

# ü•ü Ravioli Code ü§å

^ The antithesis of the god principle is apparently referred to as Ravioli code.

^ Either the Italians have a high opinion of themselves, or they've got it figured out.

^ Ravioli code is not considers a good thing, but it's better than the alternative.

^ Popularised in programming with the mis-attribution of the paraphrased quote.

^ Every line of code is written without reason, maintained out of weakness, and deleted by chance
